    "title": "About",
    "description": "Studio Maison M was founded by non-other than the drummer Sami ROGER in 2021. After 2 years of work and testing, it opened in 2023. It is located in Bondy, close enough to Paris to be accessible but still far enough to be able to make band practice or loud music playing possible at all times. Its constant evolution and new recording gears and instruments make it the perfect place to experiment and let your ideas flow without boundaries. Get ready to find weird instruments and stuff you won't find in an ordinary recording studio. You'll feel instantly home and cosy in this well decorated studio, the home you wish you could be in forever!"
